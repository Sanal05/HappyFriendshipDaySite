I wanted to give a surprise to my Friends on Friendship Day so I came up with this Idea.And created the site in 2 hours..

The features of the website:
1. It has an automatic Background music.
   * The music can be paused by clicking the pause button.And resumed by double clicking.
     ** Play Background Music button is not working on hosting.Even the pause button is looking wrong on hosting.
     
2. Embedded youtube Videos.
3. A carousel using materialize.


Cons:
1. Not mobile responsive.
2. Css work is very less.


I take full responsiblity of all the cons on my website.And I will try to correct it soon.
NOte: The hosting is done on Google Drive so it most likely to stop from 31 August 2016.
